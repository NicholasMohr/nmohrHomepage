          I care a <i>lot</i> about music.  I've been playing cello for the past 10 years and my favorite composers are Bloch and Bach. I also listen to a lot of different types of music.  Indie rock and electronic, hip hop, korean pop and korean indie music would be a basic summary of my music tastes.  With this comes a lot of opinions about music sites. I love <a href="8tracks.com" target="_blank">8tracks</a> and <a href="http://songza.com/" target="_blank">songza</a> for finding new music.  I also think <a href="https://bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">bandcamp</a> is really innovative, allowing artists to independantly release their music and get paid for it.  I like spotify but it's not particularly good for <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9226497" target="_blank">paying</a>  the artists that I actually listen to.

          I'm a big fan of Video Games-especially competitive E-Sports. I love playing SSBM (Marth), SC2 (Protoss), and Hearthstone.
